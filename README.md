# NITLang_Compiler
This repository contains the implementation of NITLang, an educational programming language designed as part of the Programming Language Design course. The project includes a complete compiler pipeline—from tokenizing and parsing to semantic analysis and code generation—and a custom-built stack-based Virtual Machine (TSVM) for execution.
